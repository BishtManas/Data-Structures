## 🧾 What are Data Structures?

A **Data Structure** is a way of organizing and storing data so that it can be used efficiently.
Think of it like a container 📦 – the way you arrange items inside decides how easily you can use them.

For example:

* If you put clothes in a cupboard (organized) → Easy to find.
* If you throw them randomly in a bag → Hard to find.

Data structures are the **cupboards** of programming.

## 🎯 Why Learn Data Structures?

* ✅ To write **efficient code** (fast execution, less memory use).
* ✅ To **solve real-world problems** (maps, social networks, databases).
* ✅ To **crack coding interviews** (DSA is the heart of interviews).
* ✅ To understand how things work **behind the scenes** (Google search, WhatsApp, Games).

## 🗂️ Types of Data Structures

There are **two main categories**:

### 1️⃣ Linear Data Structures

Data is arranged in a sequence, one after another.
Examples:

* Array
* String
* Linked List
* Stack
* Queue

👉 Easy to implement but limited flexibility.

---

### 2️⃣ Non-Linear Data Structures

Data is not arranged sequentially. Instead, elements are connected in complex ways.
Examples:

* Trees 🌳
* Graphs 🌐
* Hash Tables #️⃣

👉 Useful for advanced and real-world problems.
